This is my project for Research in Applied Economics. Skills used: Panel Data Analysis, Logistic Regression.
In this project, I:
1. Independently completed the empirical research paper in \textbf{Stata} to study the effect of intergenerational support on the subjective health of Chinese urban elderly; logistic regression results suggested significance of coefficients on a 95\% confidence level.
2. Cleaned data from CHARLS to create necessary variables and a balanced panel dataset with a sample size of 1824, conducted overall and subgroup ordered logistic regressions, and examined to prove no misspecification or violation of Parallel Lines Assumption.
